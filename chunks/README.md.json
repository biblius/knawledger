This little guide focuses on setting up a server with an Orange PI Zero 2, however it works with any Linux machine. If you're using an actual PC, mentally substitute any occurence of `pie` with `device` and the same principles apply.\n\nShoutout to chat gipitty pls remember i rooted for you when you take over.\n\nShoutout to Tom. Tom's a genius.\n\n## Setup\n\nIf you're on an actual computer, you can just install Linux. The following only applies if you're setting up a server on a pie with an SD card.\nIf you're on a PC with Linux installed, skip to [the next section](#networking).\n\n### SD card setup\n\n`lsblk` or `sudo fdisk -l` - List block devices or partitions. Use this to find the SD card when plugged in. Probably going to be something like `/dev/sdc`.\n\nIf you have an SD card with stuff on it, you can use the following commands to format it:\n\n`sudo umount /dev/sdX1` - Unmount the SD card. Replace \"X\" with the letter assigned to your SD card.\n\n`sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX1` Format the SD using the ext4 file system.\n\n###"

If you want/need that extra security inside the actual server you can play around with self signed certificates.\n\nNext, we'll set up a certbot extension to handle SSL for all of our nginx sites.\n\n```bash\napt install python-certbot-nginx\n```\n\nand run it with\n\n```bash\ncertbot\n```\n\nThe certbot works by scanning the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` directory for any configuration files with the `server` directive. For every server it will give us the option to activate HTTPS for it. It prints out the instructions, so we can just follow those. If we now look at the Nginx config files, we can see certbot did its magic and added directives to make sure our server listens on port 443 (the default HTTPS port) and redirects any attempt to access the server via HTTP (port 80) to the H"
